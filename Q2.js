/** Q2
 * assume you have two time periods
 * for example
 * period1 = 13/5/2021 01:00 to 14/5/2021 01:00
 * period2 = 15/5/2021 01:00 to 16/5/2021 01:00
 * write a function that tells us whether two given periods overlap or not
 * example CheckOverlap("13/5/2021 13:00","14/5/2021 13:00", "15/5/2021 13:00","16/5/2021 13:00" ) => no overlap
 * example CheckOverlap("13/5/2021 13:00","14/5/2021 13:00", "14/5/2021 13:00","16/5/2021 13:00" ) => overlap
