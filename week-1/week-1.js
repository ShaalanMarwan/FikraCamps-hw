/** Q5
  * Create a function that takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the same array in ascending order. Using sort() would be easy, but for this challenge YOU have to sort the array creating your own algorithm.
 
 Examples
 sortArray([2, -5, 1, 4, 7, 8]) ➞ [-5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
 
 sortArray([23, 15, 34, 17, -28]) ➞ [-28, 15, 17, 23, 34]
 
 sortArray([38, 57, 45, 18, 47, 39]) ➞ [18, 38, 39, 45, 47, 57]
 Notes
 The arrays can contain either positive or negative elements.
 The arrays will only contain integers.
 The arrays won't contain duplicate numbers.
 This is a challenge to enhance your ability, using the sort built-in won't enhance your skills.

 missingNum([7, 2, 3, 6, 5, 9, 1, 4, 8]) ➞ 10

/** Q8
  * Write a function that accepts a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive and returns a string representation of that integer written in English.
 
 Examples

 numToEng(126) ➞ "one hundred twenty six"
